# :pushpin: Detecting-phishing-URLs-using-ML

With the increase in phishing attacks, it is necessary to check if a URL is misleading or safe. The URLs sent by the attacker/hacker when clicked, gets directed to applications that look exactly the same as the original applications. When personal details are entered by the user, the attackers get direct access to credentials, which can be used for financial gain or even for a much more advanced attack on a company/organisation.

Random Forest, an ensemble machine learning algorithm has been used to predict if a given URL is safe or a phishing URL.
